# VideoCutter
This little program that I made that cuts videos together.

-------
Just put the videos in the "input" folder and songs in the "audio" folder.
You can configure a few things in the lines 9-16 in "main.py".

Requirements
-------
All requirements are listed down below and in "requirements.txt". Only ImageMagick is not listed because you need to download it from this [website](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php). 

 - Moviepy (1.0.3)
 - Numpy (1.18.2)
